    This function provides a workaround for `a bug`_ in TensorFlow Probability (fixed in `version
    0.12`_) where a :class:`tf.Module` cannot be deep-copied if it has
    :class:`tfp.bijectors.Bijector` instances on it. The function can be used to directly copy an
    object ``self`` as e.g. ``module_deepcopy(self, {})``, but it is perhaps more useful as an
    implemention for :meth:`__deepcopy__` on classes, where it can be used as follows:

    .. _a bug: https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/issues/547
    .. _version 0.12: https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/releases/tag/v0.12.1

    .. testsetup:: *

        >>> import tensorflow_probability as tfp

    >>> class Foo(tf.Module):
    ...     example_bijector = tfp.bijectors.Exp()
    ...
    ...     __deepcopy__ = module_deepcopy

    Classes with this method can be deep-copied even if they contain
    :class:`tfp.bijectors.Bijector`\ s.

    :param self: The object to copy.
    :param memo: References to existing deep-copied objects (by object :func:`id`).
    :return: A deep-copy of ``self``.
